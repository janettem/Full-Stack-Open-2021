Given an application, add React Router to it so that by clicking links in the Menu component the view can be changed. Implement a view for showing a single anecdote. After a user has created a new anecdote, transition automatically to the view for all anecdotes and show a notification informing of the successful operation.

Open this directory in a terminal.

Install the dependencies:

```

npm start
```
