Create a phonebook application. Implement the addition of a person. If a number is added to an already existing person, the new number will replace the old number. Make it possible for users to delete people from the phonebook. Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name. Create a server. Fetch the initial people from the server. Save the people that are added to the phonebook to the server. Show a notification that lasts for a few seconds after a person is added or deleted or a number is changed. Show a notification when changing a number fails.
