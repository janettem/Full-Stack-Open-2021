[The Phonebook, Step 6](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server#exercises-2-11-2-14)

Given an App component, continue to work on the phonebook application. Implement the addition of a person, prevent the user from adding names that already exist, and allow users to add phone numbers. Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name. Refactor the application by extracting at least three components from the application. Maintain the application's state and all event handlers in the App root component. Store the initial state of the application in the file db.json. Start json-server on port 3001. Modify the application such that the initial state of the data is fetched from the server using the axios-library. Complete the fetching with an Effect hook.

## Usage
Open this directory in a terminal.

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install

Run the server:

```
npm run server
```

Run the application:

```
