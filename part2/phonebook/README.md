Create a phonebook application. Implement the addition of a person. If a number is added to an already existing person, the new number will replace the old number. Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name.

Create a server. Fetch the initial people from the server. Save the people that are added to the phonebook to the server. Make it possible for users to delete people from the phonebook.
