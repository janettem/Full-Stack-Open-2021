Given index.js and App.js, refactor the code so that it consists of four new components: Header, Content, Part, and Total. All data still resides in the App component, which passes the necessary data to each component using props. Header takes care of rendering the name of the course, Content renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part, and Total renders the total number of exercises. Define the new components in file App.js. Modify the variable definitions of the App component into a single JavaScript object. Refactor the application so that it still works.

## Usage

Install the dependencies:
