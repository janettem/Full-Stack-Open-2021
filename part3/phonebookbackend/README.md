[Phonebook Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/deploying_app_to_internet#exercises-3-9-3-11)

Implement a server that returns phonebook entries. Implement a page to show the time of the request and the number of entries in the phonebook. Implement the displaying, adding, and deleting of a phonebook entry. Add the morgan middleware. Configure it to log the tiny configuration and the data sent in requests. Make the backend work with the frontend from the previous part. Deploy the backend to the internet, for example to Heroku. Generate a production build of your frontend, and add it to the internet application.
